\title{State-Space Deep Gaussian Processes with Applications}

\begin{document}

\includepdf[pages=-]{title-pages/title-pages.pdf}

\draftabstract{This thesis is mainly concerned with state-space approaches for solving deep (temporal) Gaussian process (DGP) regression problems. More specifically, we represent DGPs as hierarchically composed systems of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and we consequently solve the DGP regression problem by using state-space filtering and smoothing methods. The resulting state-space DGP (SS-DGP) models generate a rich class of priors compatible with modelling a number of irregular signals/functions. Moreover, due to their Markovian structure, SS-DGPs regression problems can be solved efficiently by using Bayesian filtering and smoothing methods. The second contribution of this thesis is that we solve continuous-discrete Gaussian filtering and smoothing problems by using the Taylor moment expansion (TME) method. This induces a class of filters and smoothers that can be asymptotically exact in predicting the mean and covariance of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) solutions.  Moreover, the TME method and TME filters and smoothers are compatible with simulating SS-DGPs and solving their regression problems. Lastly, this thesis features a number of applications of state-space (deep) GPs. These applications mainly include, (i) estimation of unknown drift functions of SDEs from partially observed trajectories and (ii) estimation of spectro-temporal features of signals.}

The research work in this thesis has been carried out in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Aalto University, during the years 2018-2021. My doctoral studies officially started in April of 2018, while most of the pivotal work came in 2020-2021. During this time, my doctoral research was financially supported by Academy of Finland and Aalto ELEC Doctoral School. The Aalto Scientific Computing team and the Aalto Learning Center also provided useful computational and literature resources for my studies. I particularly enjoyed the Spring, Autumn, and Winter in Finland, which allowed me to find inner peace and focus on my research.

I would like to offer my greatest gratitude to Prof. Simo S\"{a}rkk\"{a} who is my supervisor and mentor, and without whom this work would never have been possible. After finishing my master studies in Beijing University of Technology in 2017, I found myself lost in finding a ``meaningful'' way of life in the never-sleeping metropolis that is Beijing. This quest was fulfilled when Simo offered me the opportunity of pursuing a doctoral degree under his supervision. Disregarding my bewilderment on the research path in the beginning, Simo's patience and valuable guidance led me to a research area that I am fascinated in. Over the years, Simo's help, support, and friendship have helped me become a qualified and independent researcher. I think very highly of Simo's supervision, and I almost surely could not have found a better supervisor. 

During my years in the campus, I owe a great thanks to Rui Gao (\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{bkai}高~睿\end{CJK}) who is a brilliant, learnt, and erudite researcher.

I would like to thank these few people that have accompanied me through joy and sorrow, I name: Adrien Corenflos and Christos Merkatas. I thank you for the friendship and relieving me from solitude\footnote{This was written under constraint.}.  

During my years in Aalto university, I have shared my office with Marco Soldati, Juha Sarmavuori, Janne Myll\"{a}rinen, Fei Wang (\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{bkai}王~斐\end{CJK}), Jiaqi Liu (\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{bkai}劉~佳琦\end{CJK}), Ajinkya Gorad, Masaya Murata (\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{bkai}村田~真哉\end{CJK}), and Otto Kangasmaa. I thank them all for filling the office with happiness and joy. I especially thank Marco Soldati who offered me honest friendship, lasagne, and taught me many useful Italian phrases. My thanks also go to Lauri Palva, Zenith Purisha, Joel Jaskari, Sakira Hassan, Fatemeh Yaghoobi, Abubakar Yamin, Zaeed Khan, Xiaofeng Ma (\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{bkai}馬 曉峰\end{CJK}), Prof. Ivan Vujaklija, Dennis Yeung, Wendy Lam, Prof. Ilkka Laakso, Marko Mikkonen, Noora Matilainen, Juhani Kataja, Linda Srbova, and Tuomas Turunen. All these amazing people made working at Aalto a real pleasure. I would also like to give my thanks to Laila Aikala who kindly offered me a peaceful place to stay in Espoo.

I warmly thank Prof. Leo K\"{a}rkk\"{a}inen for the collaboration on the AI in Health Technology course and our inspiring discussions on many Thursdays and Fridays. I particularly enjoyed the collaboration with Muhammad Fuady Emzir who offered me knowledge generously and with no reservations. Many thanks go to my coauthors Prof. Roland Hostettler, Prof. Ali Bahrami Rad, Filip Tronarp, and Toni Karvonen. I also appreciated the collaboration with Sarang Thombre and Toni Hammarberg from Finnish Geospatial Research Institute, Prof. Ville V. Lehtola from University of Twente, and Tuomas Lumikari from Helsinki University Hospital. I also thank Prof. Lassi Roininen and Prof. Arno Solin for their time and valuable advice. 

Lastly, I would like to thank my parents and sister who support me persistently as always.
