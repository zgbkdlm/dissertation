This thesis is mainly concerned with state-space methods for a class of deep Gaussian process (DGP) regression problems. As an example, one can think of a family of DGPs as solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and view their regression problems as filtering and smoothing problems. Additionally, this thesis also presents a few applications from (D)GPs, such as system identification of SDEs and spectro-temporal signal analysis.

Supervisor: Prof. Simo Särkkä.

Pre-examiners: Prof. Kody J. H. Law from The University of Manchester and Prof. David Duvenaud from University of Toronto.

Opponent: Prof. Manfred Opper from University of Birmingham.

The public defence of the thesis will be streamed online on December 10, 2021 at noon (Helsinki time) via Zoom link https://aalto.zoom.us/j/67529212279. It is free and open to everyone.

More details regarding the thesis itself can be found in its title pages.

# Contents

The dissertation is in `./dissertation.pdf`. Feel free to download and read~~

**Note that you may also find an "official" version in [aaltodoc](http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-952-64-0603-9) published by Aalto University. However, it destroyed the PDF links and outline, making it very painful to read in computer/ipad/inktablet. I believe that you will feel more enjoyable reading `./dissertation.pdf` instead. In terms of content, the one here has no difference with the one in aaltodoc.**

1. `./dissertation.pdf`. The PDF of the thesis.
2. `./errata.md`. Errata of the thesis.
3. `./cover`. This folder contains a Python script that generates the cover image.
4. `./lectio_praecursoria`. This folder contains the presentation at the public defence of the thesis.
5. `./scripts`. This folder contains Python scripts that are used to generate some of the figures in the thesis.
6. `./thesis_latex`. This folder contains the LaTeX source of the thesis. Compiling the tex files here will generate a PDF the same as with `./dissertation.pdf`.
